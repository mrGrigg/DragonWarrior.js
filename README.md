# DragonWarrior.js

A javascript game engine meant to facilitate the playing of dragon warrior, like an emulator, 
but instead to re-write the game, for fun and not profit.

My goal is to keep a blog about my process, what I learn, and what I use. Since I work on the game so infrequently, I update the blog infrequently as well. I also plan on making all of the tiles and artwork that I'm manipulating for the game available as well.

### Reasoning
Because I want to do it myself.
It's fun to learn things and figure stuff out. I have no idea how to write a game engine, but, every once in a while
I have an idea, so I make something here. I've made very little progress, but when I do work on it, I always end
up learning something new.
